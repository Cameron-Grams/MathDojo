        <p class="smallText">The Math Dojo is a site for children to practice basic math skills. Each session is chosen for difficulty  
            based on the intensity of the animal representing that session name.</p>  
        <p  class="smallText"> Students log in, go to their account dashboard and <span style="color: red"><b> select the session</b></span> for that day; based on animal intensity, type of math operation
            and the range of numbers the student wants to work with. 
            The profile lets the student track their progress over time by observing their overall accuracy during the session.  
            <span style="color:green"><b>Sessions are color coded</b></span> red, yellow and green for low, medium and high accuracy in the session.   
            Past sessions can be reviewed to see if there is a trend or area where specific improvement is needed.</p>

    <p class="smallText">As the student trains they will <span style="color:blue"><b>advance in belt levels</b></span> indicating progress towards mastery of basic mathematics.</p>
    <ul class="smallText" id="beltList">   
        <li>White Belt</li>
        <li>Yellow Belt</li>
        <li>Orange Belt</li>
        <li>Green Belt </li>
        <li>Blue Belt</li>
        <li>Brown Belt</li>
        <li>Black Belt</li>
        <li>Ninja</li>
    </ul>  
<p class="smallText" >...becoming a Ninja takes hard work and time! Belts are awarded based on points accumulated in training, one point for each correct answer.</p>  

<p class="smallText" >The student must select how hard they wish to train; do you feel like training like a Mouse or a Bear?  
Bears train for longer, and progress more rapidly since longer sessions have more questions which lead to more points.  If you answer correctly! </p> 

<p class="smallText"> The student will select the number range for the questions to be asked.  The questions will be provided randomly, but the student can select the overall range.  
The low and high end must be separated by more than 5 digits. Divison will be correct out to three decimal places of accuracy, for example: 0.123; you will need to calculate the fourth decimal place and then round to three.
