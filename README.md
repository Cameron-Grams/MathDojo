# Math Dojo

## [The Site on Heroku](https://warm-badlands-54373.herokuapp.com/math-dojo.html) 

This site was developed for the young children in my extended family; several of my nephews are learning their early mathematics and this is a place where they can practice.  The choice of animals and martial arts as a theme was made because I know they appeal to at least some of the kids.  Hopefully it will serve as a way to keep them engaged and working to develop their skills.
